# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a summary DataFrame for V. Isualize, the CEO of the PyBer ride-sharing company. This summary gives insight into the performance of the company during the 2019 year, grouped by three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. The data in the summary shows us Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Drive for each city type. Additionally, we created a visual representation of the weekly total fares by city type between January 1st, 2019 through April 29th, 2019.

## Results

The results of our analysis, as presented in our Pyber Summary below, show the following results for the five metrics analyzed:

- Total Rides: Total rider count is highest in Urban cities and lowest in Rural cities, with Urban cities having 13 times more riders - 1625 to 125 respectively. Suburban cities rank in between with a total of 625 rides.
- Total Drivers: The highest count of total drivers is in Urban cities and the lowest is in Rural cities; Urban cities have nearly 31 times more drivers than Rural cities. Suburban cities rank in between with 490 total drivers.
- Total Fares: The highest sum of total fares is in Urban cities and is lowest in Rural cities. Urban cities generated ~9.2 times more USD in total fares than Rural cities - $39,854.38 and $4,327.93 respectively - and nearly twice as much as Suburban cities, which generated $19,356.33.
- Average Fare per Ride: Average fares per ride were highest in Rural cities at an average $34.62, followed closely by the Suburban cities whose average cost per ride was $30.97. The average cost per ride in Urban cities came out to $24.53.
- Average Fare per Driver: Average fares per driver were highest in Rural cities at $55.49, followed by Suburban cities who had an average fare of $39.50 per driver, and Urban cities had the lowest average fares per driver at roughly $16.57.
