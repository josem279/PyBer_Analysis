# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a summary DataFrame for V. Isualize, the CEO of the PyBer ride-sharing company. This summary gives insight into the performance of the company during the 2019 year, grouped by three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. The data in the summary shows us Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Drive for each city type. Additionally, we created a visual representation of the weekly total fares by city type between January 1st, 2019 through April 29th, 2019.
